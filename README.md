# MyAI

# Introduction
Large language models(LLM) have revolutionalized the way we access information.
A quick trip to ChatGPT which is a Generative Artificial Intelligence(GenAI) app built
on LLM produces results based on the vast data it was trained on. The question that arises
is that of proprietary data which it was not trained on. In other words, how do you gain insights
from a private PDF file, videos or articles that are not publicly available on the internet?

# My project's use case
My project which is an app I call "MyAI" is a custom solution to one of the challenges mentioned
above. It allow users upload a pdf file and chat about this file to gain insights on it. In the
screenshot below, I uploaded a pdf file that talks on strategies for reading research papers,
and went on to ask questions about this file in an interactive Q&A pattern.

# Future updates

* Add link to deployed project website. At the moment here is a link to a youtube video where I demonstrated
a live usage of the app. [Project Demo](https://youtu.be/A8UYSwneuS8)

* Improve functionality to include processing of video files

# Team
I worked on this project alone. My aim was to understand the end to end process of building a full stack app
